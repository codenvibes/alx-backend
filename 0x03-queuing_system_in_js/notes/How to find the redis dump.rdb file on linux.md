## How to find the redis <code>dump.rdb</code> file on linux

The `dump.rdb` file is the default location where Redis stores its snapshot of the data set, which is used for persistence. By default, this file is located in the directory specified by the `dir` configuration parameter in the Redis configuration file (`redis.conf`). The exact location can vary depending on how Redis was installed and configured on your system.

### Default Locations

#### When Installed from a Package Manager (e.g., apt, yum)

When Redis is installed using a package manager, the default configuration file is usually located at `/etc/redis/redis.conf` or `/etc/redis.conf`.

To find the directory where `dump.rdb` is stored, you can:

1. **Check the Redis configuration file:**

   Open the Redis configuration file (`redis.conf`) and look for the `dir` directive. This specifies the directory where `dump.rdb` is stored.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
   ```

   Look for a line like:

   ```conf
   dir /var/lib/redis
   ```

   This means the `dump.rdb` file will be located in `/var/lib/redis`.

2. **Use the Redis CLI:**

   You can also find the configuration using the Redis CLI. Connect to your Redis server and use the `CONFIG GET` command:

   ```bash
   redis-cli CONFIG GET dir
   ```

   This will return the directory where the `dump.rdb` file is stored.

#### When Compiled from Source

If you compiled and installed Redis from source, the default location for `dump.rdb` will typically be in the directory where Redis was started. However, this can be changed by specifying the `dir` directive in your custom `redis.conf`.

### Example Steps to Find `dump.rdb`

1. **Check the Redis configuration file:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
   ```

   Find the `dir` directive:

   ```conf
   dir /var/lib/redis
   ```

2. **Verify with Redis CLI:**

   ```bash
   redis-cli CONFIG GET dir
   ```

   This should output something like:

   ```plaintext
   1) "dir"
   2) "/var/lib/redis"
   ```

3. **Locate the `dump.rdb` file:**

   Once you know the directory, list the files in that directory:

   ```bash
   ls /var/lib/redis
   ```

   You should see the `dump.rdb` file if it exists:

   ```plaintext
   dump.rdb
   ```

### Summary

By default, the `dump.rdb` file is usually stored in `/var/lib/redis` or the directory specified in the `dir` directive of your `redis.conf`. Checking the `redis.conf` file or using the Redis CLI with the `CONFIG GET dir` command will help you find the exact location.

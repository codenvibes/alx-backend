## How to kill the Redis server using its process ID (PID)

To kill the Redis server using its process ID (PID), you need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Find the Process ID (PID) of the Redis Server

You can find the PID of the running Redis server using the `ps` command on Unix-like systems.

#### On Unix-like Systems (Linux, macOS)

Use the `ps` and `grep` commands to find the PID of the Redis server:

```bash
ps aux | grep redis-server
```

This command will list all processes with the name `redis-server`. The PID is usually the second column in the output.

### Step 2: Kill the Redis Server Process

Once you have the PID of the Redis server, you can kill the process using the `kill` command on Unix-like systems.

#### On Unix-like Systems (Linux, macOS)

Use the `kill` command followed by the PID:

```bash
sudo kill <PID>
```

If the process does not terminate, you can force kill it using the `-9` option:

```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID of the Redis server.

### Example

#### Finding and Killing Redis Server on Unix-like Systems

1. Find the PID:

    ```bash
    ps aux | grep redis-server
    ```

    Example output:

    ```bash
    user       1234  0.0  0.1  123456  7890 ?        Ssl  10:00   0:00 redis-server *:6379
    user       5678  0.0  0.0   6276   888 pts/0    S+   10:01   0:00 grep --color=auto redis-server
    ```

    In this example, the PID of the Redis server is `1234`.

2. Kill the process:

    ```bash
    kill 1234
    ```
